I am a PhD student in the School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering at University College Dublin, having started my PhD in September 2025. I completed my undergraduate degree in Theoretical Physics at UCD. My research focuses on developing computational models of the heart, with a particular interest in applications related to xenotransplantation. Through this work, I aim to use modelling to better understand cardiac mechanics and support research at the intersection of engineering and biology.

My main interests are in computational fluid dynamics, numerical methods, and their application to biological systems. I work primarily with OpenFOAM and enjoy using computational tools to model complex physiological flows and structures.
