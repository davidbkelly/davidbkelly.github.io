## Overview
This final-year BSc thesis (Theoretical Physics, University College Dublin) investigates how networks of spiking neurons can exhibit gamma-frequency (30–100 Hz) resonance and synchrony under different connectivity and synaptic conditions. The project was awarded a **First Class Honours** grade.

## What I did
- Simulated inhibitory networks of Izhikevich neurons, comparing sparse random and all-to-all coupling while controlling for average synaptic input.  
- Introduced second-order synaptic dynamics to more realistically capture synaptic current time courses under external noise.  
- Derived a low-dimensional mean-field model and performed bifurcation analysis to explain the emergence of coherent oscillations.
  
## Key results
- Sparse and fully connected networks produced comparable synchrony and firing behaviour when total input per neuron was matched, showing a trade-off between connection probability and synaptic strength.  
- The mean-field system exhibits a Hopf bifurcation at a critical synaptic strength (approximately g ≈ 0.09), beyond which stable gamma-band oscillations emerge.  
- Tuning synaptic kinetics similarly induces the transition (bifurcation around τs ≈ 1.56 ms), highlighting how synaptic time constants shape gamma rhythms.
