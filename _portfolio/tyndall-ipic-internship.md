## Overview
I completed a 12-week summer research internship at **Tyndall National Institute** within **IPIC – the SFI Research Centre for Photonics**, working in the **Biophotonics** group. The project focused on improving the quantitative accuracy of Raman spectroscopy measurements in highly scattering and absorbing biological media.

## Research focus
Quantitative Raman spectroscopy in biological tissue is strongly affected by **tissue turbidity**, where scattering and absorption distort spectral intensities. These effects lead to significant variability in measured Raman signals, even for samples with identical molecular composition. The goal of this project was to develop and validate a method to correct for these distortions.

## What I worked on
- Investigated how absorption and scattering coefficients influence Raman signal recovery in diffusive media using **tissue-mimicking phantoms** with known optical properties.    
- Applied a **modified Beer–Lambert law** to estimate the effective number of Raman scattering interactions within samples of varying turbidity. 
- Used **MCXLab (GPU-based Monte Carlo simulations)** to model photon transport and Raman scattering paths through turbid media.    
- Analysed how Raman interaction counts decay exponentially with absorption and increase linearly with scattering, demonstrating that these effects can be corrected given accurate optical properties.  

## Outcomes
- Demonstrated that turbidity has a strong and quantifiable impact on Raman signal recovery.  
- Showed that Raman intensity distortions can be mitigated by incorporating absorption and reduced scattering coefficients into the analysis framework.  
- Identified future applications of the method for **quantifying hydroxyapatite in bone** and **methemoglobin in stored blood**, with relevance to biomedical diagnostics.
