This talk presents a framework for coupling a three-dimensional left ventricle model with a zero-dimensional closed-loop cardiovascular circulation in OpenFOAM. By integrating lumped-parameter Windkessel elements with a dynamically contracting ventricle, the approach enables physiologically consistent simulation of cardiac haemodynamics and provides a foundation for predictive in-silico assessment of xenotransplant heart performance.
