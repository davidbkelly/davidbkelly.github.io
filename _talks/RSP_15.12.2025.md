excerpt: "First Research Studies Panel meeting, outlining initial plans for PhD."
---

As part of my PhD at University College Dublin, I held my first Research Studies Panel (RSP) meeting with my supervisor, Prof. Philip Cardiff, and panel members Dr. Kevin Nolan and Dr. Malachy O’Rourke. The RSP is designed to provide an additional perspective on the research and to offer guidance on the overall direction and development of the project. During the meeting, I presented my initial research plan and received constructive feedback and advice that will help shape the next stages of my PhD.
